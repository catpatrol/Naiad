=== STATUS_SYSTEM — 2026-07-28 ===
NOW: Optimization track resumed. Three operator rulings taken: re-test Cowork before building any scheduler, a local Google Drive sync folder exists so offsite archiving can be automated, and the daily routine runs every day at 07:00. The routine is being built now; its trigger is deferred pending the Cowork capability test.
LAST EVENT: 2026-07-28 — interview rulings taken; .venv rebuild + routine build paste issued.
FACTS:
- Cowork settings show "Run new tasks in the cloud" OFF and Cowork files rooted at the naiad folder; the earlier cloud-only test result reflected a chat, not a folder-attached task [verified]
- A virtualenv cannot be relocated (absolute paths hardcoded); rebuild-then-delete is the only safe path, and a scheduled task must call python by full path [verified]
- Routine is composable by design: scripts/routine_jobs.json is a job registry, so new jobs are added by config, not code [ratified]
- ENGINE handoff drafted covering six archived phases, census_run2 deduplication, the narrowed D5 basis and the two blocking CENSUS-1c rulings [handoff]
- STATUS blocks now written to this file via paste rather than emitted in chat, per operator request [ratified]
- s3_excursion_substrate.jsonl stays git-tracked as a documented exception; removing it would rewrite every commit hash the ledger cites [ratified]
PENDING:
1. Cowork re-test (new task, naiad folder attached) — decides scheduler vs Cowork
2. Register the trigger once that answer lands
3. backup_estate.py build — needs Amendment 1 filed to the repo plus the Drive path from Part B
4. Q-1 / Q-2 CENSUS-1c rulings — still gate the ENGINE lane
5. Deliver the ENGINE handoff into that chat's context
NEXT: Operator runs the Cowork re-test; SYSTEM chat holds the backup_estate paste pending its result.
